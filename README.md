ðŸ“Š Decision Tree Regression â€“ Car Price Prediction
This section of the project focuses on implementing Decision Tree Regression, a powerful non-linear supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous valuesâ€”in this case, car prices.

ðŸ”§ Key Steps:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Model building using DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree

Training and testing the model on processed data

Evaluation using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizing how the model fits and predicts from the data

ðŸŒŸ Highlights:

Handles both linear and non-linear relationships

No need for feature scaling

Provides interpretable tree-based decision rules

Effective in modeling complex data patterns
